# In the script below I create a function that schedules your classes 
# I define each class, and define each time.
# I Create a loop using WHILE, which will schedule a class with a time at different times
# At the end of the code it should display a class with a time to attend that class.

def schedule_classes(classes, times):
  schedule = []

  index = 0
  while index < len(classes):
    scheduled_class = classes[index] + ": " + times[index]
    schedule.append(scheduled_class)
    index += 1

  return schedule


classes = ["Algebra", "History", "Biology", "Swimming"]
times = ["9a.m.", "11a.m.", "1p.m.", "3p.m."]
schedule = schedule_classes(classes, times)
print(f"Monday's schedule: {schedule}")

Answer:
Monday's schedule: ['Algebra: 9a.m.', 'History: 11a.m.', 'Biology: 1p.m.', 'Swimming: 3p.m.']
