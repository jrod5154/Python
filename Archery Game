# In the script below, I create a code that gives a character(Archer) actions to preform in A Archery Game.
# I come up with the class Archer as the character preforming the actions
# Then I give the character actions such as ,shoot,reload.
# Then I create a function that when the archer hits a bullseye he gets plus 3 points. 

class Archer:
  arrows = 10
  points = 0
  empty = False
  def shoot(self):
    if self.arrows > 0:
      print('Aim... and shoot!')
      self.arrows -= 1
    else:
      self.empty = True

  def bullseye(self):
    self.points += 3
    
  def reload(self):
    if self.empty == True:
