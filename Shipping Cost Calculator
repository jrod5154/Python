# In the script below I create a calculator to calculate the shipping cost from purchase total

international_shipping = True

total = 150
shipping_cost = 0

if international_shipping: 
  shipping_cost += 15
  print("International base cost applied")

if total <= 50:
  shipping_cost += 20
elif total <= 100:
  shipping_cost += 15
else:
  shipping_cost += 5

print(f"Shipping cost: {shipping_cost}")
