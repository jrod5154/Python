# In the script below I create a common code that preforms the actions, that a everyday vending machine preforms.
#I give the class Soda Machine, then I define some of its functions such as, eject_soda, pay, and select_soda
# Eject soda funtion checks if you paid for the drink or not, if you did it will dispense your drink
# The pay function  shows the balance you owe 
# The select_soda fucntion selects the soda you want if paid.
