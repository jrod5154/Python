# In the script below I create a compound intrest calculator for a bank account, that stacks intrest on the account over 3 years.

account = 100
interest_rate = 0.004
years = 3

print(f"Initial amount: {account}")

counter = 1
while counter <= years:
  accrued_interest = account * interest_rate
  account += accrued_interest
  print(f"year {counter}: {account}")
  counter += 1
